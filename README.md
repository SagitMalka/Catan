# Settlers of Catan Game
Welcome to the Settlers of Catan game implementation in C++! This project aims to recreate the popular board game Settlers of Catan in a text-based format using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

## Overview
The Settlers of Catan is a strategy board game where players collect resources and use them to build roads, settlements, and cities on a hexagonal board. The goal is to earn victory points by expanding and developing settlements.


## Features
- Player Actions: Build roads, settlements, and cities; trade resources; buy and use development cards.
- Resource Management: Collect resources (wood, brick, sheep, wheat, ore) based on dice rolls.
- Game Rules: Follows the basic rules of Settlers of Catan, including the robber mechanic and resource distribution.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following directories:
- model/: Contains the core logic and data structures (Player, Tile, Settlement, Board, etc.).
- controller/: Manages game flow and rules enforcement (Game). It is also contains the view that handles user interface and interactions (text-based output and input handling).


### Installation
